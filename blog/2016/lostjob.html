                        <p>It was in the winter last year, when I was still working.</p>
                        <p>I was as easy to get annoyed as I am now, though I tried to contain myself in the working place and didn’t quite use to burst out shouts or cries when working. As I would always stay up until well after midnight reading with or chatting over my phone, I would always be late or ask for a leave, feel sleepy and distracted, and finally fall asleep the next morning. Things got worse in the winter.</p>
                        <p>Also I used to procrastinate until deadline—or forever. I would always procrastinate as I still do now, reading irrelevant articles or chatting over QQ when working. I have been trying to use to-dos and the Pomodoro technique to tame my procrastination, but they are, by now, of rather little use to me.</p>
                        <p>My teamwork was awful as well. Thanks for their toleration over those months.</p>
                        <p>It’s been another four months since I got fired. Now, when I start thinking, I would feel desperate and guilty. I would rather be reading JavaScript books. And I want to be hired again, if I were able to—but I am afraid not.</p>
