                        <p>Eukaryotic cells, though bearing similarities to bacterial and especially archaeal cells from the molecular perspective, have also major differences from them, among which are the presence of membrane-bound organelles—especially the cell nucleus which stores the majority of the cellular genetic material, separation of transcription and translation, and extensive post-transcriptional modification inside the cell nucleus.</p>
                        <p>The NCLDVs are a clade of large dsDNA viruses which parasite on different groups of eukaryotes. Maybe due to humans’ struggle against smallpox, viruses of the poxvirus family <i>Poxviridae</i> to which it belongs might be the best studied NCLDV family by now. They replicate in host nucleus or cytoplasm, and have double-strand DNA and mostly linear genomes. Striking resemblance between the viral factories formed by many of them and the cell nuclei has been observed, which has shed light on the origin of eukaryotes.</p>

                        <h3>From smallpox to vaccinia: the study of poxviruses</h3>
                        <p>Smallpox, officially announced to be eradicated by the WHO in 1979, is the first of the only two infectious diseases eradicated in human history. Its eradication and vaccination has led to extensive research on poxviruses, especially the orthopoxviruses, or the smallpox-causing variola virus and its relatives like cowpox, vaccinia, monkeypox, among others.</p>
                        <p>The best known usage of the vaccinia virus is as the smallpox vaccine, and maybe therefore it has become the best-studied one of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs). Unlike most of the DNA viruses—including some of the other NCLDVs—poxviruses replicate completely in the host cytoplasm, and when replicating, they form a viral factory wrapped by the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Well adapted to that, poxviruses have many virally encoded enzymes to facilitate cytoplasmic DNA replication, transcription and post-transcriptional modification.</p>
                        <h3>5’ capping, a unique process in eukaryotic post-transcriptional modification</h3>
                        <p>By late 1970s, it has been known that in eukaryotic cells, heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA), the initial transcript, goes through post-transcriptional modification to form mature mRNA, its procedures including 5’ capping, 3’ polyadenylation, and excision of introns, among which 5’ capping is important and unique.</p>
                        <p>5’ capping facilitates mature mRNA to enter the cytoplasm across the nuclear envelope, prevents mature mRNA from degradation catalyzed by exonucleases, and provides a site for eIF4F and ribosome recognition, therefore promoting translation.(1)</p>
                        <p>It was also known then that poxviruses, such as the vaccinia virus, also perform 5’-capping, which is almost the same procedure as that of eukaryotes. Vaccinia-infected cultured cells like HeLa cells were used to study the capping process, and the virally encoded enzymes responsible for each of the steps can be found inside the viral factory.(2)</p>
                        <p>Using the viruses, it was then revealed that the 5’ capping is actually a complex process, involving three to four different enzymes. Now it is known that the 5’ cap (cap-0) consists of a guanine nucleotide connected to mRNA via an unusual 5’ to 5’ triphosphate linkage. This guanosine is methylated on the 7 position directly after capping <i>in vivo</i> by a methyltransferase, referred to as a 7-methylguanylate cap, abbreviated m<sup>7</sup>G. In multicellular eukaryotes and some viruses, further modifications exist, including the methylation of the 2’ hydroxy groups of the first 2 ribose sugars of the 5’ end of the mRNA.(1)</p>
                        <h3>The poxvirus viral factory: like the cell nucleus, somewhat</h3>
                        <p>Not only the capping process resembles the eukaryotic equivalent, but the structure of and the cytoplasmic replication inside the viral factory formed by poxviruses show striking similarity to the nuclear counterpart. The viral factory is a miniature of the cell nucleus in many ways.</p>
                        <p>Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of membrane proteins are important in the membrane assembly and disassembly both of the cell nucleus and of the viral factory, complete membrane wrapping is required for DNA replication both in poxvirus and in the cell nucleus, and poxviruses separate transcription from translation like eukaryotic cells do at least in early stage of infection.(3) Due to those similarities, viral factories poxviruses form give inspirations to nuclear envelope dynamics, and have often been likened to mini nuclei.(4)</p>
                        <h3>Not only poxviruses: NCLDVs grouped together</h3>
                        <p>Other large dsDNA viruses have been found, including the largest ones which have reached the average bacterial size, and are collectively called nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs). While most other DNA viruses replicate their DNA in the nucleus, NCLDVs do so in the host cytoplasm instead, although some initiate replication inside the nucleus and finish it in cytoplasm. They cap their mRNAs, as well as form ER-membrane-wrapped factories in the host cytoplasm—both like what poxviruses do.</p>
                        <p>NCLDVs include poxviruses (family <i>Poxviridae</i>), African swine fever virus (ASFV, family <i>Asfarviridae</i>), and families <i>Iridoviridae</i>, <i>Ascoviridae</i>, <i>Phycodnaviridae</i>, <i>Mimiviridae</i>, and <i>Marseilleviridae</i>. Besides vertebrates, they parasite on many other eukaryotic organisms, among them being insects (some of the poxviruses), protists (like mimiviruses which parasite on Acanthamoeba), and algae.</p>
                        <p>A lot of genetic evidence deduced from sequences and high-level structures of their common, and in most cases essential, proteins, such as the DNA clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), capsid proteins, and many enzymes involved in their DNA replication, transcription, and post-transcriptional modification, tends to suggest that NCLDVs form a monophyletic group—it is natural and phylogenetically correct to group them together.(5)</p>
                        <p>The NCLDV common ancestor might have a fairly large share of genes (a majority, as examined in the reference) most affined with their eukaryotic orthologs, suggesting the genes’ eukaryotic origin—or the reverse, as would be shown in the next section; yet it still probably had many of its genes of bacterial, archaeal, bacteriophage, or uncertain origins.(6)</p>
                        <h3>What if cell nuclei originated from viruses?</h3>
                        <p>It is hard to ignore the similarities between the viral factories NCLDVs form and the eukaryotic nuclei: what if the viruses and the cell nuclei are evolutionarily related? Therefore the sexy and mind-blowing hypothesis emerged—viral eukaryogenesis. It suggests that a primitive lysogenic virus might have parasited on an ancestral archaean host, replicated itself in the NCLDV-like way, absorbed much of the host genetic material and finally, instead of entering the lytic pathway, it usurped the role as the “nucleus” of genetic material.(7)</p>
                        <p>Under this hypothesis, many of the intricate facts about eukaryotic cells might get explained: they appear just like corresponding viral traits. An example is eukaryotes’ separation between transcription and translation. 5’-capping, as mentioned above, might also have first occurred in ancestral NCLDVs which parasited on an ancestral archaean in response to host degradation of external RNA molecules.</p>
                        <p>However, viral eukaryogenesis hasn’t yet become the consensus of the scientific community, and it still needs more evidence to prove or falsify.</p>
